## Hello! 👋

<details>
<summary>About Me</summary>
<br>
  
I'm Razeen, a 3rd year Computer Engineering student at Ryerson.

I have a passion for computers, I like developing apps as well as working with microcontrollers. I've built some personal and academic projects all of which can be found here on my Github. I have gained a lot of hardware/software experience from working alongside Ryerson professors and design teams to develop software applications and build robots. 

I'm quite interested in machine learning and artifiical intelligence, I am still in the process of learning but I love learning more about computers and picking up new skills and hobbies along the way.

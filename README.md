I have a passion for computers. I enjoy programming, building things using parts such as microcontrollers and overall learning more about computers. I've built some personal and academic projects all of which can be found here on my Github, these projects have allowed me to apply what I've learned in my program and to further my knowledge and sharpen my skills.
